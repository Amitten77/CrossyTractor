## How to play

So, our game is a one player or two player game! If you are playing with one player, you can control the combine with the "AWSD" keypad:
"A": left
"S": down
"W": up
"D": right

Your goal is simple: collect the corn and avoid running over the pigs and cows with the combine.


With two players, using the left and right arrow, the second player can control the farmer at the top of the map, and if you press the top arrow when the farmer is right above an animal, he'll lasso it away. The farmer and the combine are working together!
